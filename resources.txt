In addition to these resources, it is important to practice your system design skills by working on real-world problems. You can find these problems on a variety of websites, such as LeetCode and HackerRank.

When practicing, it is important to focus on the following:

Communication: In a system design round, you will need to be able to clearly communicate your design choices to the interviewer. This will help them understand your thought process and your ability to think critically.
Scalability: Your design should be scalable to handle a large number of users and requests.
Fault tolerance: Your design should be able to handle failures without impacting the availability of your system.
Security: Your design should be secure and protect user data.
By following these tips, you can improve your chances of success in a system design round.

Here are some additional tips for system design interviews:

Start by understanding the problem. What are the requirements of the system? What are the constraints on the system?
Brainstorm possible solutions. Don't be afraid to come up with multiple solutions.
Choose the best solution. Consider the pros and cons of each solution.
Discuss the trade-offs. Explain why you chose the solution you did.
Think about scalability. How will the system scale as it grows?
Think about fault tolerance. How will the system handle failures?
Think about security. How will you protect user data?
Be prepared to answer questions. The interviewer will likely have questions about your design. Be prepared to answer them in a clear and concise way.
